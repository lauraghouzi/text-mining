***Project Overview***

I decided to use Project Gutenberg as my data source for this project. I 
chose two different books for my analysis: The Great Gatsby by F. Scott 
Fitzgerald and A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens. What I wanted to 
do for this project is to take two very famous books (which happen to be 
my favorite ones) and see the word frequencies, the differences between 
the most used words and the major differences between these two books from
different eras. I used mulitple types of data for this project such as tuples,
dictionnaries, boolean, strings and lists. All of these helped me through out
the project

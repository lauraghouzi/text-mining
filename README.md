**ASSIGNMENT 2**

The coding part of this assignment can be found in folder 
Part 2 & 3, it is named Part 2; it will have all of the 
algorithms and the code I wrote. The project writeup and 
reflection can also be found in the folder named Part 2 & 3, 
under the name Part 3.

PS: Part 2 of the code has a hard time working because of the fuzz 
library, so I put it at the end of the code if you want to put #
in order to run the rest of the code. Thank you for your understanding :)
